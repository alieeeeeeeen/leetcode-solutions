# My solutions for Leetcode in C++

## Prerequisites

Since leetcode contains almost all fundamental algorithms, we need to be familiar with the algorithm such as, `binary search`, `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `sort`, `linked-list` and etc. Also, we may frequently use `recursive function`. We also need to know the structure of `recursive function`.

## Programming Language

Since I use C++ to implement all the algorithms, I will frequently use `unordered_map` and `vector`. These are all containers in C++. So to be familiar with all the basic operations of the container.

## Check Your Result

After you complete the algorithm, check it to see if the code can be passed through the test cases.
